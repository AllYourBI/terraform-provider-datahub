# datahub_schedule (Resource)

Manages a Datahub Schedule. A schedule defines when one or more jobs should run based on a cron expression.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "datahub_job" "example_job_1" {
  name  = "my-example-job-1"
  type  = "full"
  image = "myregistry.azurecr.io/my-job-image:latest"
}

resource "datahub_job" "example_job_2" {
  name  = "my-example-job-2"
  type  = "full"
  image = "myregistry.azurecr.io/another-job-image:1.2"
}

resource "datahub_schedule" "daily_run" {
  schedule = "0 0 3 * * *" # Run daily at 3 AM UTC
  enabled  = true
  start_at = "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  # end_at = "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z" # Optional end date
  # maximum_drift = 600 # Optional: Skip if missed by more than 10 minutes
  # backfill = false # Optional: Don't run for past missed schedules

  bindings = [
    {
      job_id = datahub_job.example_job_1.job_id
      # Optional overrides for job 1
      environment = {
        "MODE" = "PRODUCTION"
      }
    },
    {
      job_id = datahub_job.example_job_2.job_id
      # Optional overrides for job 2
      command = ["--specific-flag", "value"]
      secrets = {
        "API_KEY" = "override-secret-value" # Note: Secrets defined here override job secrets but are stored in TF state.
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
